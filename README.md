# Swimy

Swimy tranforms clusters in a graph into swimlanes like in processes modeling.

It uses http://www.graphviz.org/ and the gvpr âˆ’ graph pattern scanning and processing language http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/gvpr.1.pdf

Swimy does execute dot to get the graph calculated and then pipe it to Swimy which does the magic and finally neato produces the final output.

Based on the type of shapes of nodes, Swimy:
* moves `triangle` are locked on the left (or on the top).
* moves `invtriangle` are locked to the left (or the bottom).
* and clean every edges points of shape `box`, in order to give some space to each line.

## Usage

For each sub graph (ie cluster), every LL (low left) position is capture and compare to the other one in order to find the one closest to the right.
Let's to the same with the UR (upper right) position to guess the one closest to the top of the graph.

It is required:
* to set a precise set of shapes for your nodes `shape=triangle`.
* to set `constraint=false` on some of your edges, the one that are not part of the happy path. otherwise your clusters may hide other.

##Command lines
You need to choose if you want the graph to be "Top / Bottom" or "Left / right".
Use a `input.dot` as a sample graph.

Run the following command:
* `dot input.dot | gvpr -c -fswimy.g | neato -n2 -Tpng > output.png`

or use those command lines to see intermediary steps:
* `dot input.dot -o output.dot`
* `neato -T png -O output.dot`
* `dot input.dot | gvpr -c -falign_top.g -o output.dot`


If you want to change the layout of you diagram, just change in input.dot, the `rankdir` value to `TB` or `LR`:

* `rankdir=TB;overlap=scalexy;splines=ortho;sep=1;nodesep=1;`
* `rankdir=LR;overlap=scalexy;splines=ortho;sep=1;nodesep=1;`
